        Forgiveness is a fundamental principle we strongly believe, taught by Jesus Christ himself. In the context of the gospel, forgiveness is closely tied to the concept of the Atonement—the belief that Jesus Christ suffered and died for the sins of humanity, thereby offering redemption and reconciliation with God. Forgiveness is also portrayed as a way to heal and restore relationships. By extending forgiveness to others, we open the door to reconciliation and the possibility of rebuilding trust and understanding. This process of forgiveness can be challenging and may require humility, patience, and empathy, but the rewards of restored relationships and inner peace are invaluable.
        In the context of mortal relationships, forgiveness serves as the "lubricant" that enables individuals to navigate the challenges and conflicts inherent in human interactions. It allows us to extend grace and compassion to one another, recognizing our shared humanity and our inherent worth as children of God. Through forgiveness, we can cultivate a sense of unity and brotherhood/sisterhood, fostering a community built on love and mutual respect.
        Overall, forgiveness is a powerful principle that lies at the heart of many religious traditions, offering hope, healing, and reconciliation to those who embrace it. As we strive to emulate the example of Jesus Christ and extend forgiveness to others, we can experience greater peace, joy, and fulfillment in our lives.

        In a society where marriage is under attack and families are degraded, we are tasked with honoring our marriages, nurturing our children, and fortifying our families. Marriage demands love, respect, and devotion, as we fulfill sacred covenants to cherish and support our spouses. Parenthood is a divine responsibility, requiring us to raise our children in the ways of the Lord. Despite life's distractions, our children are our greatest treasures, and the gospel provides the means to build enduring family bonds.

        As an organization committed to upholding traditional marriage values, we firmly oppose the legalization and recognition of same-sex marriage. Our position is based on our deeply held beliefs and principles, which are rooted in both religious teachings and societal norms that have stood the test of time. First and foremost, we believe that marriage is a sacred institution established by a higher power, whether it be seen as a divine ordinance or a fundamental societal building block. From this perspective, marriage is defined as a union between one man and one woman, designed to foster companionship, procreation, and the nurturing of children within a stable family unit.
