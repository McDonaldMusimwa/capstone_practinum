Failure to recognize or embrace His significance undermines the effectiveness of the overarching plan of happiness. Furthermore, it is emphasized that human philosophies often fall short in comprehending the eternal purposes of God, underscoring the need to prioritize divine wisdom over secular concepts for enduring fulfilment and understanding.</p>
